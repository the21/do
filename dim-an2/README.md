# Hello Thermometer

## Setting up
Either clone the browser-hello-thermometer repository or use the "Download Zip button" from the right hand menu

### Getting the relayr SDK
Either clone the SDK and link to the the Library or download a copy of the file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relayr/browser-sdk/master/lib/relayr.min.js
put in the lib directory

###Getting jquery
We use jQuery in the example to make it a little simpler, but the relayr library does not require it itself

## Running the code
If you have a server available on your machine, you can launch that for example on OSX:

```bash
cd browser-hello-thermometer
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Alternatively you can open the index.html file in your browser.
